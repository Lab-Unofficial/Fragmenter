# Fragmenter

## Introduction

This repository contains Python classes or utilities that are designed to facilitate sequence generation for fragments to be inserted into a plasmid backbone via scarless cloning. All utilities support Python 3.8.

## Contents
* **Fragmenter** - A class that provides automated sequence generation for scarless cloning.

## Dependencies

**None !**

## Usage Example

As demonstrated below, fragment sequences can be generated by specifying a payload sequence as well as the restriction enzymes to be used on the 5' and 3' ends. Optionally, the user can also specify restriction enzymes for accessory fragments, such as a hammerhead complement, to generate those sequences as well.

```python
>>> from fragmenter import Fragmenter
>>> frag = Fragmenter()
>>> frag.sequence = 'AATTGCTCCTTCATGACACG'
>>> frag.RE_5 = 'BbsI'
>>> frag.RE_3 = 'BbsI'
>>> frag.RE_5_HH = 'SapI'
>>> frag.RE_3_HH = 'SapI'
>>> frag.report
```

```
Sequence provided: AATTGCTCCTTCATGACACG
Fragment 5' RE: BBSI
Fragment 3' RE: BBSI
Forward fragment (24 nucleotides)
Reverse complement fragment (24 nucleotides)

fwd      5'➔ 3' : NNNNAATTGCTCCTTCATGACACG
rev comp 3'➔ 5' :     TTAACGAGGAAGTACTGTGCNNNN
rev comp 5'➔ 3' : NNNNCGTGTCATGAAGGAGCAATT

Hammerhead 5' RE: SAPI
Hammerhead 3' RE: SAPI
FWD HH fragment (12 nucleotides)
REV HH fragment (12 nucleotides)

HH fwd      5'➔ 3' : NNNCGTGTCATG
HH rev comp 3'➔ 5' :    TCATGACACNNN
HH rev comp 5'➔ 3' : NNNCACAGTACT

Cut sites found in fragments: []
NOTE: Replace all N nucleotides to match the plasmid backbone digest sites!
